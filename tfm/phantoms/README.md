# Phantom files

This directory is empty, as phantom files are too large to be stored on GitHub. Instead, they have been included in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14984766).

Once downloaded from Zenodo, you need to place the phantom files in this `/phantoms` directory for everything to work correctly.
