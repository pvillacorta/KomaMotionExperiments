# KomaMRI Motion Experiments

This repository contains a set of experiments related to publications of the [KomaMRI](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl) project, specifically those focused on dynamic phantoms. The experiments are organized into directories, each corresponding to a different publication.

## Directory Structure

- [`/mrm`](https://github.com/pvillacorta/KomaMotionExperiments/tree/main/mrm): Contains the experiments carried out in Sections 4 and 5 of:

  Villacorta-Aylagas P, Castillo-Passi C, Kierulf R, Menchón-Lara RM, Rodríguez-Galván JR, Sierra-Pallares J, Irarrazaval P, Alberola-López C. **Versatile and Highly Efficient MRI Simulations of Arbitrary Motion in KomaMRI**. *Magn Reson Med*. 2025.

- [`/tfm`](https://github.com/pvillacorta/KomaMotionExperiments/tree/main/tfm): Contains the experiments carried out in Section 4.1 of the Master's Thesis:

  *Contributions to Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Simulation: A Model for Dynamic Simulation and a Web Interface for Pulse Sequence Development and Visualization*.

  These experiments focus on the simulation of dynamic phantoms and their visualization, as described in the thesis.

## How To Use

Each of the above directories contains its own README with specific instructions  
on how to download the scripts and reproduce the corresponding experiments.
