# KomaMRI Motion Experiments

This repository contains a set of experiments related to publications of the KomaMRI project, specifically those focused on dynamic phantoms. The experiments are organized into directories, each corresponding to a different publication.

## Directory Structure

- [`/tfm`](https://github.com/pvillacorta/KomaMotionExperiments/tree/main/tfm): Contains the experiments carried out in Section 4.1 of the Master's Thesis:

  *Contributions to Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Simulation: A Model for Dynamic Simulation and a Web Interface for Pulse Sequence Development and Visualization*.

  These experiments focus on the simulation of dynamic phantoms and their visualization, as described in the thesis.
