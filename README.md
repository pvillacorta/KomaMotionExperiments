# KomaMRI Motion Experiments

This repository contains a set of experiments related to publications of the [KomaMRI](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl) project, specifically those focused on dynamic phantoms. The experiments are organized into directories, each corresponding to a different publication.

Additional information about motion in KomaMRI can be found in its [official documentation](https://juliahealth.org/KomaMRI.jl).

## Directory Structure

- [`/mrm`](https://github.com/pvillacorta/KomaMotionExperiments/tree/main/mrm): Contains the experiments carried out in Sections 2 and 3 of:

  P. Villacorta-Aylagas, C. A. Castillo-Passi, R. A. Kierulf, et al., *Versatile and Highly Efficient MRI Simulation of Arbitrary Motion in KomaMRI*, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 95, no. 3 (2026): 1791–1803, https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.70145.

- [`/tfm`](https://github.com/pvillacorta/KomaMotionExperiments/tree/main/tfm): Contains the experiments carried out in Section 4.1 of the Master's Thesis:

  *Contributions to Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Simulation: A Model for Dynamic Simulation and a Web Interface for Pulse Sequence Development and Visualization*, [https://uvadoc.uva.es/handle/10324/77414](https://uvadoc.uva.es/handle/10324/77414).

  These experiments focus on the simulation of dynamic phantoms and their visualization, as described in the thesis.

## How To Use

Each of the above directories contains its own README with specific instructions on how to download the scripts and reproduce the corresponding experiments.
