# KomaMRI Motion Experiments

This repository contains a set of experiments related to publications of the [KomaMRI](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl) project, specifically those focused on dynamic phantoms. The experiments are organized into directories, each corresponding to a different publication.

Additional information about motion in KomaMRI can be found in its [official documentation](https://juliahealth.org/KomaMRI.jl).

## Directory Structure

- [`/mrm`](https://github.com/pvillacorta/KomaMotionExperiments/tree/main/mrm): Contains the experiments carried out in Sections 4 and 5 of:

  Villacorta-Aylagas P, Castillo-Passi C, Kierulf R, Menchón-Lara RM, Rodríguez-Galván JR, Sierra-Pallares J, Irarrazaval P, Alberola-López C. **Versatile and Highly Efficient MRI Simulations of Arbitrary Motion in KomaMRI**. *(submitted to Magn Reson Med)*. 2025. \
  [https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.70145](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.70145)

- [`/tfm`](https://github.com/pvillacorta/KomaMotionExperiments/tree/main/tfm): Contains the experiments carried out in Section 4.1 of the Master's Thesis:

  *Contributions to Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Simulation: A Model for Dynamic Simulation and a Web Interface for Pulse Sequence Development and Visualization*. \
  [https://uvadoc.uva.es/handle/10324/77414](https://uvadoc.uva.es/handle/10324/77414)

  These experiments focus on the simulation of dynamic phantoms and their visualization, as described in the thesis.

## How To Use

Each of the above directories contains its own README with specific instructions on how to download the scripts and reproduce the corresponding experiments.
