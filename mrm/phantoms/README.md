# Phantom files

This directory is intentionally left empty, as phantom files are too large to be stored on GitHub. Instead, they are hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15588103).

These phantom files will be automatically downloaded and added to this directory as the corresponding experiments in the repository are executed. Specifically:

- 1.2 Aorta PC: Downloads `aorta_2M_spins.phantom`
- 2.3a CMRsim PC: Downloads `sUbend_1p5M_spins_turb.phantom` and `sUbend_4M_spins_noturb.phantom`
- 2.3b JEMRIS PC: Downloads `fortin_2M_spins.phantom`
